    <b> Endangered Indiginous Languages</b>
         <p style="color:white;">
     
  The language of each nation is characteristic of its cultural identity. Different ethnic groups express their origin, identity, history, culture, and literature in their language. Therefore, it can be said that with the decline of a language, the ethnic groups and the originality of that people will be destroyed; a person without a language is like a person without a heart.
The Endangered Languages page in Ethnologue (http://www.ethnologue.com/endangered-languages) states that of the 7097 languages spoken in the world today, 1495 are considered endangered and another 918 are classified as dying. Since 1950, 360 languages have become extinct.
In “How do you define an endangered language,” UNESCO (2016) states that “A language is endangered when its speakers cease to use it, use it in fewer and fewer domains, use fewer of its registers and speaking styles, and/or stop passing it on to the next generation.”
The most commonly used factor in evaluating the vitality of a language is whether or not it is being transmitted from one generation to the next (Fishman 1990). Endangerment can be ranked on a continuum from stability to extinction. 
UNESCO (2003) provided a classification system to show just how 'in trouble' the language with regards to Intergenerational Language Transmission:
      <ul>
<li>Vulnerable - most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home);</li>
<li>Definitely endangered - children no longer learn the language as a 'mother tongue' in the home;</li>
<li>Severely endangered - language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves
<li>Critically endangered - the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently;</li>
<li>Extinct - there are no speakers left;</li>
     </ul>
We tried to visualize UNESCO data, retrieved from the Guardian website in a static map (by QGIS) and a D3 chart.

<!--  <p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 15pt"> Introduction </p>
    <p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 5px;text-align: justify;  font-size: 10pt"> Ottawa is well known for its access to many social, community, and health based services for children. For new residents, it is important to understand the services available to them and if their family can benefit from them. Ottawa ranks eighth in the list of cities with the largest landmass in Canada with a landmass of 2,778 squared kilometers. Not to mention its rising population of over a million people. So how do we keep track of services available to long term and new residents and their children? Well, there are a few data sets and articles that highlight important services already. However, not everything is covered in these networks especially small private businesses that are not well known to the public. That is why it is crucial to obtain information from the general public regarding the whereabouts of these smaller businesses that provide social, community, and health based services. It is the responsibility of the long term residents with the local knowledge to contribute to crowd source information. This website takes aim at obtaining crowd sourced information about the social, community, and health based services and provide an interactive inventory of the services facilities. It is also the responsibility of the new residents that discover these services to help other new residents discover the locations of the services. Hence why this website can empower these actions.
    </p>

<p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 15pt"> User Responsibility </p>
<p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 3px;margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 10pt"> You, as the user will have a chance to contribute to the geolocational information of these services. This is achieved by locating these services on your own time, then bringing this knowledge to a geoweb application. The user’s responsibility can be broken down into two categories. First being the provider and the second being an information seeker. The provider provides the geolocational and supporting information regarding the specific service. The information seekers role is to retrieve information from the geoweb service by browsing crowd sourced data that was provided by the provider. </p>


<p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 15pt">    How to use the website in 3 easy steps:    </p>

        <li> Select “Add a Location” tab located in the top left corner
        <li> Fill out generic form. Please try to be as accurate as possible as this helps to increase the accuracy of the data collection especially when it comes to addresses </li>
        <li> Select “Map” tab to see the newly inputted information from the form. The blue ribbons are the location of the inputted services by users.

      </ol>

<p style="margin: 5%; margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 15pt"> Hospitals </p>
<p style="margin: 5%;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:5px;text-align: justify;font-size: 10pt"> In fact Ottawa’s Civic hospital is ranked 11th overall for care in Canada in 2022, the Queensway Carleton following up in 19th , and the Montfort Hospital in 55th. Needless to say considering there are about 1,300 hospitals nation-wide and all three major hospitals in Ottawa rank in the top 100, the citizens of Ottawa can sleep assured that the quality of care is there when needed.</p>

<p style="margin: 5%;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;text-align: justify;font-size: 15pt">  Parks and Recreation  </p>
<p style="margin: 5%;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:5px;text-align: justify;font-size: 10pt"> Ottawa is ranked number one in Canada for having the most urban parks in a city. There is approximately 20 acres per 1000 residents. As many people know it is important for children to get outside, explore, and play. Ottawa offers a variety of parks that are accessible from all over the city. However, there are plenty of parks outside of the city limits that are not publicly displayed in City data sets as seen below. There is more to explore and share for the public. This is your chance to discover new parks in and around the city and share them with others. </p>

<p style="margin: 5%;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;text-align: justify;font-size: 15pt">   Community and support Centers  </p>
<p style="margin: 5%;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:5px;text-align: justify;font-size: 10pt">As we all know it is crucial for children and adults to have access to community and social support centers. These centers not only provide a safe space for individuals but provide them with the resources they need to succeed. Whether that would be networking within a community, seeking mental and or social help, or even addiction help. These services are crucial to the well being of the residents in Ottawa. As of right now there are only 4 centers in all of Ottawa. These centers
provide an enormous range of services for people but can often become inundated with clients. Therefore the more geolocational data collected for these services the better equipped people might be to seek out specific community and social support services.  </p>
